This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

## Install Expo

iOS: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/expo-client/id982107779
Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent


## How to run the app

`npm install` and then `npm start` (or `yarn install` and then `yarn start`)

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```
npm start --reset-cache
# or
yarn start --reset-cache
```


### Testing 

This app is tested on iPhon6 iOS 11.4
